We launched CodeLauncher at the beginning of 2022, and it is an app we use every day. Here is a plan to make it more useful in the future.

## Terminal

The output area should work more like a Terminal:

* Accept keyboard input as some server-side software can be controlled with keyboard input, e.g., Minecraft Java Edition server.
* Support control characters to support color and some more complicated output like `htop`.

## Log Output

Support more log output destinations like files or even syslog servers.

## UI Refinements

The project editor should use a multi-tab design to make working with multiple tasks easier.

## Deployments

The logical next step for most web-related projects is deployment. It could be a simple `git push` or a custom command. We will explore more ways to integrate the support for deployments in CodeLauncher.
