In the first minor update of CodeLauncher, we fixed these issues:

- A bug in parsing arguments. Now a command with complex arguments like this works: `nginx -g "daemon off;"`.
- An issue in reading stderr that was causing a high CPU load.

And we made a small adjustment to the color used for indicating the status of a task:

- Green for running task
- Red for stopped task with non-0 exit code
- Gray for stopped task with 0 exit code
